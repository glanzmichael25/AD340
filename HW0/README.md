Michael Glanz
I prefer to be called Michael.
I am interested in creating mobile applications and am looking forwared to learning how to develope apps throughout this course. My hope is to become proficient with mobile development so that I can move into a developer role at my current employment.
For my technology backup plan, I have my previous laptop that I can use if my primary computer crashes.
